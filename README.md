A basic calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, following the final lesson in [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Clear the display to start a new calculation.
- An actual UI, which looks cool I guess
